# Notes
* debounce clicks on quantity-selector
* use sections to create scope for snippets and prevent snippet reference leakage
* newsletter section with block for each esp form and max-blocks: 1;
* `data-product-container="{{ product.handle }}"` attribute on element that holds data about a specific product (e.g. product-card, product page add to cart form, etc.)
* use Maps with dom nodes as keys to keep track of different states
* every snippet needs a `classes` and `extra_attrs` property to prevent fall through from parent snippets
* use grid
